    <h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>
    
    <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries.Each has  given me a unique learning experience.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong>At</strong> five,I <a href="http://www.starz.Com">Marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the of  piazza  San  Marco feeding horders of Pigeons, then glided down  Venetian  Waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, magalithic structure of Stonehenge and  <a href="http://www.starz.com"><img src="new5.jpg" alt="new" style="width: 400px;float:left; margin-right: 20px; height: 270px;"></a> walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br> <a href="//https:www.starz.Com">Starz University.</a> <br>
           <br> <br>  It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language. 
            <br><br> It began with French, which taught me the importance of
            pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris
            where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
            PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on
            the A, she looked at me bewildered. 
            <br> <br> In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
            aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
            Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
            different but sounds nearly the same.</div> </p>
            This was incredible to  me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognatescome to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.  <a href="mailto:herichwizkiddalieh@gmail.com">Send us Email.</a> <br> <br> 

         </p>
         <p> Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
            school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, <br> the meaning is lost. I
            loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning
            fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), <br> which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty
            and rhythm as I form them.
